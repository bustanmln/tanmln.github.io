Introduction

The Moildev library is a collection of functions that support the development of fisheye
drawing applications based on the Python programming language. You can visit this
documentation to explore this library.

Each project we do has an important role for a documented work history, where the
document must be archived as evidence of the implementation of the project that has been
developed through various applications.

We archive this documentation digitally to make it easier for users to better understand the
concepts of the Moildev library and to prevent the loss of the files they need at any time.
